Since I don't see an obvious \"New Project\" button in the visible elements, I will look for a general \"Create\" or \"+\" button in the header area. I see a \"Create new issue\" button (index 4253) near the search bar, but I need to create a project, not an issue.

The URL in the tab is `https://linear.app/softlight-linear-test/projects/all`, which suggests I am on the projects page. I will check the main content area for a \"New Project\" button. Since the screenshot shows the navigation bar with \"Projects\" highlighted, I am likely on the correct page, but the main content area is empty (black screen). I will look for a button to create a new project. I'll look for a button with text \"New project\" or a \"+\" sign in the main content area. Since no such button is immediately visible in the interactive elements, I'll scroll down to ensure I haven't missed anything, although the page seems fully visible. I will try to find a \"New project\" button in the main content. Since I don't see one, I will re-examine the screenshot for any visual cues. I see a \"+\" sign next to the \"Display\" button in the top right, but it's not indexed. I will try to use the `find_text` action to locate a \"New project\" or \"Create project\" button. Since I don't have a find_text, I will check the available interactive elements again. I will assume the page is still loading the content for the \"Projects\" view, as the main area is black. I will try to click the \"Create new issue\" button (index 4253) to see if it brings up a general creation menu that includes projects, or maybe use the keyboard shortcut 'C' for create.
